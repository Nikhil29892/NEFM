## Overview

**NEFM (Nikhil's Expansion Force Model)** introduces the concept of **Plant Growth Force (PGF)** — an internal biomechanical force generated by the combination of turgor pressure and cell expansion. This model explains how plants can grow vertically by working against gravity, without requiring external mechanical support.

## Core Formula

**PGF = P × E**  
Where:  
- **P** = Turgor Pressure (N/m²)  
- **E** = Cell Expansion Force  

A new unit called **1 Nikhil** is proposed:  
`1 Nikhil = 1 (N/m²) × elasticity constant`

## Key Concepts

- PGF is a **gravity-opposing internal force**
- Driven by **biological conditions**: turgor pressure, cell elasticity, light, nutrients
- Symbolic experiments with **tissue, coin, and foil** illustrate the concept

## Applications

- Plant-based robotics  
- Engine-less vertical lift systems  
- Gravity-opposing propulsion  
- Biomimicry and agricultural optimization
